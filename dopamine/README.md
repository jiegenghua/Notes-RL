# Dopamine: A Research Framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Key point:
- Type of research objectives:
  - Architecture research: network topology, component interactions (e.g. reply memory in DQN), A2C/A3C (fixed-length segment with rolling trajectories), ACER, Reactor, IMPALA
  - Algorithmetic research: improve underlying algorithms (e.g. double DQN), Retrace($$\lambda$$)
