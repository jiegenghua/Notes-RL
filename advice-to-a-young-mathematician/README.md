# Advice to a Young Mathematician

## Michael Atiyah
- Strong internal motivation and fully dedicated are important to succeed. 
- Initial years are difficult. So much to learn, struggle with small problems unsuccessfully. 
- Intense mental concentration -> psychological pressure: interaction with fellows, seminars, conferences, idle conversation to gain social support. Too much isolation and introspection are dangerous. 
- Read books & papers, but focus working on specific problems, then develop theory that leads to the solution. 
- Curiosity: what is the context the result holds true ? Is there a more natural proof ? What if removing the assumptions ?
- Given a beauiful result, spend time to find an elegant proof firstly. Thinking hard about it in my own way is better than passively following other people's reasoning. 
- Find good examples to test and push general results in extreme conditions, it gives insight and understanding, keeping feet on the ground.
- Proof is just an end product of a long interaction between creative imagination and critical reasoning. 
- To make progress in a problem, one has to understand its roots. Ask your own questions, what similar work has been done, what are their limitations. 
- How to write papers:
  - Sketch whole logical structure, break up ideas into intermediate steps
  - Write introduction at last, explains clearly the structure, main results and general context. 
  - Put aside paper for some time and come back, rewrite with new angle and make it clearer and easier to read. 
  
## Bela Bollobas
- Be persistent, bear the problem in mind and keep brain open. 
- Making mistakes is not fatal, full of waste notes of failed attempt is better than blank sheet. 
- Doing simplest case of a problem can be very useful. 
- Read many papers in your area by best people to gain a taste of high quality ideas. 
- Be alert during paper reading, try think up a better attack, ask questions about the results and proofs. \
- Keep ability to be surprised, not just take for granted. Spend a great deal of time to digest new ideas. Don't just read and understand the proof, but feel them in the blood. 

## Alain Connes
- When fighting with a complicated problem, go for a long walk and do computation in the head. It trains working memory and sharpen the skill. 
- Laid down in the dark on a sofa and fight with intense problem. Isolete yourself and concentrate. But after that, being socially interactive. 
- Being brave and turn setbacks into positive energy for working harder. 
- Caring too much about others' opinion is a waste of time. 

## Dusa McDuff
- Overcome the fear of being ignorance to actively ask questions. 
- Better kick off by the simplest question, it is easier to understand the complicated problem.
