# Advice to a Young Mathematician
## Michael Atiyah
- Strong internal motivation and fully dedicated are important to succeed. 
- Initial years are difficult. So much to learn, struggle with small problems unsuccessfully. 
- Intense mental concentration -> psychological pressure: interaction with fellows, seminars, conferences, idle conversation to gain social support. Too much isolation and introspection are dangerous. 
- Read books & papers, but focus working on specific problems, then develop theory that leads to the solution. 
- Curiosity: what is the context the result holds true ? Is there a more natural proof ? What if removing the assumptions ?
- Given a beauiful result, spend time to find an elegant proof firstly. Thinking hard about it in my own way is better than passively following other people's reasoning. 
- Find good examples to test and push general results in extreme conditions, it gives insight and understanding, keeping feet on the ground.
- Proof is just an end product of a long interaction between creative imagination and critical reasoning.
